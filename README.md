## NetScrypt ##

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ew2gxkxo7p0jxci7/branch/master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vbfox/netscrypt/branch/master)

This library is a wrapper for the [scrypt key-derivation ](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.htm)function created by Colin Percival. The core of the library is a copy of the scrypt KDF routines written in C and distributed by Colin.

* To **Colin Percival** for the [scrypt paper](https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf) and C reference implementation.
* To Replicon for [Replicon.Cryptography.SCrypt](https://github.com/replicon/Replicon.Cryptography.SCrypt) that I heavily used both as an inspiration for the API and as a Copy-Paste source for code and documentation.
